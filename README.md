### About me

Flexibility of thinking and the ability to adapt to the requirements of the rapidly changing world of technology are one of the key skills of a modern person.

I am used to achieve high results in the areas of interest to me (physics, electronics). Now I am mastering the field of Data Science, as I consider it the most promising, in demand, well-paid and with the possibility of remote work. And most importantly - it is also incredibly interesting! Definitely, DS is what I need!

I took a number of courses in ML and Python.
I listen to lectures of: K.V. Vorontsov, E.A. Sokolov, R.G. Neichev, E.V. Razinkov.

I play beach volleyball and run.

### ML Experience

* Pet project: [web service for applying ML models](https://ivankud.com): 2023
  - Problems: instance segmentation, sentiment classification, classification of handwritten digits
  - Models: Dense and Convolutional networks, pretrained Mask R-CNN and RoBERTa
  - Libraries: PyTorch, OpenCV, Transformers
  - Cloud provider: DigitalOcean (GCP was used before)
  - Containerization: Docker, Compose
  - Backend: FastAPI
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - HTTPS: Traefik
* ML training projects and test tasks: 2020 â€“ 2023
  - Hierarchical text classification into more than 1000 classes. Models: random forest with LCN and LCPN approaches. Libraries: pymorphy2, scikit-learn, hiclass, networkx
  - Text classification with a limit on the model size and inference time. Containerization: Docker. Models: TF-IDF, fastText, catboost. Libraries: pymorphy2, scikit-learn, fastText, catboost
  - Car price prediction according to data from the site auto.ru. Dataset was parsed from the site (price, characteristics, equipment, photo, text description). Models: multi-input NN (tabular+CV+NLP). Libraries: beautifulsoup, scikit-learn, Keras
  - And other tasks using regressions, trees, boosting, transfer learning, fine tuning, stacking, feature generation, feature significance analysis, dimensionality reduction, overfitting protection (regularization, cross-validation, data augmentation, model complexity reduction). Working with unbalanced samples, outliers, gaps, duplicates, dirty data (format mismatch, dimensions, garbage)
