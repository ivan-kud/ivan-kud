### About me

Flexibility of thinking and the ability to adapt to the requirements of the rapidly changing world of technology are one of the key skills of a modern person.

I am used to achieve high results in the areas of interest to me (physics, electronics). Now I am mastering the field of Data Science, as I consider it the most promising and in demand. In addition, a specialist in this field is not strictly tied to a specific location. And most importantly - it is also incredibly interesting! Definitely, DS is what I need!

Took a number of courses in ML and Python.
I listen to lectures from: K.V. Vorontsov, E.A. Sokolov, E.V. Razinkov, R.G. Neichev.

I play beach volleyball and run.
