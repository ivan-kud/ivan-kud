### About me

Flexibility of thinking and the ability to adapt to the requirements of the rapidly changing world of technology are the key skills of a modern person.

I am used to achieve high results in the areas of interest to me (physics, electronics). Now I am mastering the field of Data Science, as I consider it the most promising, in demand, well-paid and with the possibility of remote work. And most importantly - it is also incredibly interesting! Definitely, DS is what I need!

I play beach volleyball and train in the gym.

### ML Experience

* Since October 2023 I have been working as an NLP engineer. I train AI assistants in new skills and implement this in the form of services.

* Stack: Python, LangChain, Hugging Face, OpenAI, Docker, FastAPI, Streamlit.
