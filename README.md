### About me

Flexibility of thinking and the ability to adapt to the requirements of the rapidly changing world of technology are the key skills of a modern person.

I am used to achieving high results in the areas that interest me: extensive experience in machine learning and electronics; PhD in physics.

I play beach volleyball and work out in the gym.
